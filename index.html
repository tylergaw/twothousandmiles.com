<p>Rad, it has been over 7 months since I have updated this site. I'm awesome, what is cool is that it has been that amount of time since I have shaved, so that's cool. In the coming months this site is going to be completely revamped. When I get the time that is. FD is on tour right now with The Rend. The just released a 5 song split sampler with them as well <a href="/web/20060815190529/http://finaldrive.org/media.html">check it out</a></p>

<p>Yeah it would be rad if the retards putting the freakin' 300 a nonsense guestbook post would stop that shit. If I find out would it is and they are within reaching distance I will kick you in the balls. Anyway I'll just delete the fuckers anyway.

The boys are still looking for a bass player, but are not sweating it much. They continue to practice and work on new material. The new year will surely bring good things to FD. Happy freakin' Holidays

<p>If you didn't see it on the official FD site they no longer have a bass player. Just a miner setback, they are still going into the studio to record soon and I'm sure a new bass player will not be hard to find.

Have a good Turkey eating day!

<h5>2005-09-04</h5>
<p>Whoa, yeah the site has been down for a damn long time. I've been too busy with school. I did get a video up, it is a motion graphics project that I did for a class a while back.

<p>Well I guess I lied, I said the site would be updated a lot but this is my first update in almost a month. Hey I'm busy. This is a big update. For me at least, i'm now implementing a PHP backend. I realize this means nothing to those of you who aren't fellow web developers, but I'm excited. Anyway FD is currently officially on break.They played a hell of a show on July 2nd at the Creepy Crawl(video up soon) and Another on July 16th at the Midwest Music Pit. I got to see the new bass player Steve play on the 2nd, and he is a beast. They are now hard at work on new material.</p>
<h5>2005-07-18</h5>
<p>welcome to the first Final Drive Fansite on the web. i'm very excited about working on the site and will make it the best I can for me and for the band. </p>
