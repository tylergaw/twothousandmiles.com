# The 2nd Site I designed and built

I did this in 2005 mostly for practice. Final Drive is my brother's band.

I had really simple admin written in PHP for the news updates. I had my DB
username and password in plain text in every PHP file that needed to connect to
the DB, so that's fun.

It's not on there now, and long gone, but when I first put this up there was a
guestbook that was completely overrun my spam.
